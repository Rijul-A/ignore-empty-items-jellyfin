# Jellyfin Plugin: Ignore Empty Folders

Automatically hides content that have no media files in their folders.

## What it does

After every library scan, the plugin finds all content with zero
actual media files and removes them from the Jellyfin database. The
folders on disk are left untouched — when you later add media files,
the next scan picks them up and the content stays.

This is useful if you maintain a folder structure for upcoming content
(with subtitles, NFO files, etc.) but don't want them cluttering your
library until the actual media files are available. It currently
supports the following content types:

- Movies
- TV shows
- Music artists
- Music albums
- Collections
- Playlists
- Folders

## Installation

### From plugin repository (recommended)

Add this repository URL in **Dashboard > Plugins > Repositories**:

```
https://jonathanduvalv.github.io/jellyfin-ignore-empty-folder/repository.json
```

Once added, the plugin will appear in the plugin catalog and can be
installed and updated directly from the Dashboard.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest `ignore-empty-folders-X.X.X.zip` from
   [Releases](../../releases)
2. Create a plugin directory in your Jellyfin config:
   ```
   /config/plugins/Ignore Empty Folders_{version}/
   ```
3. Extract the ZIP contents (DLL + `meta.json`) into that directory
4. Restart Jellyfin

### Building from source

Requires .NET 9 SDK:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

The DLL is output to:
`Jellyfin.Plugin.IgnoreEmptyFolders/bin/Release/net9.0/`.
Copy it to:
```
/config/plugins/Ignore Empty Folders_1.0.0.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.IgnoreEmptyFolders.dll
```

## Configuration

Go to **Dashboard > Plugins > Ignore Empty Folders** to configure:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Enable plugin | On | Master toggle. When disabled, no cleanup runs. |
| Log removed shows | On | Write a log entry for each item. |

## How it works

The plugin provides two mechanisms:

1. **Post-scan task** — Runs automatically after every library scan.
   Finds all `Series` items with zero non-virtual, non-missing
   `Episode` children and deletes them from the database.

2. **Scheduled task** — "Clean Empty Series" appears in
   **Dashboard > Scheduled Tasks**. Runs every 24 hours.
   Can also be triggered manually.

Both mechanisms share the same logic and respect the plugin's
configuration.

### What gets removed

A series is removed when it has **zero** episodes that are:
- Non-virtual (not metadata-only placeholders)
- Non-missing (not marked as unavailable)

Series with any real video files are always kept.

### What stays on disk

The plugin only removes entries from Jellyfin's database. Your folder
structure, metadata files, subtitles, and any other files on disk are
never touched.

## Limitations

- Empty series will briefly appear during a library scan before the
  post-scan task removes them
- If the plugin is disabled or uninstalled, empty series will reappear
  on the next scan
